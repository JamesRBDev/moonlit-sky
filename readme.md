# Moonlit Sky v3.0 + MUSHclient v5.06

The Moonlit Sky MUSHclient package was designed as a plugin suite for the multi-user dungeon game Armageddon (https://armageddon.org). It is the most powerful graphical client available for the game, offering a minimap with fog of war, an inventory panel, and vital bars. Along with hundreds of highlights, command aliases, and other utilities.

## Installation

There are a few necessary steps before you can hop right into the game. Read on!

1. Download the client .zip file from the Github releases section. (https://github.com/JamesRBDev/moonlit-sky/releases)
2. Extract the contents into your Documents folder.
3. Once extracted, double-click the `Armageddon.exe` file to run the client. You can also create a shortcut of it for easier access. If the client says that a file is read-only or needs write permission, try running it as an administrator.
4. Under `File`, click `Open World` and select `Armageddon.mcl` to start up the world. This will connect you to Armageddon.
5. Once you get to the game's menu, you will want toggle on ANSI/VT100 for colors, bolds, and italics. Then when you get in-game, use the `armasetup` command to get things started.
6. If the output stretches off of your screen, cutting off the text, then press `ALT+ENTER` and under `Appearance>Output`, change the font size to be smaller. If you'd like to use the font that I recommend, it's 'Inconsolata' and can be installed from within the client's folder.
7. The first time you exit the client, it will ask you for a save state folder. Simply select the folder titled `state` from the list.
